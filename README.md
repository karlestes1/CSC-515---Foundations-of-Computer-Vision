# CSC 515 - Foundations of Computer Vision
**Disclaimer:** These projects were built as a requirement for CSC 515: Foundations of Computer Vision at Colorado State University Global under the instruction of Dr. Brian Holbert. Unless otherwise noted, all programs were created to adhere to explicit guidelines as outlined in the assignment requirements I was given. Descriptions of each [programming assignment](#programming-assignments) and the [portfolio project](#portfolio-project) can be found below.

*****This repository will be archived upon completion of the class.*****

### Textbook
The textbooks for this class were [**Computer Vision and Image Processing: Fundamentals and Applications**](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9781351248396/computer-vision-image-processing-manas-kamal-bhuyan) by **Manas Kamal Bhuyan** and [**Computer Vision: Principles, Algorithms, Applications, Learning**](https://www.elsevier.com/books/computer-vision/davies/978-0-12-809284-2) by **E. R. Davies**
### VS Code Comment Anchors Extension
I am also using the [Comment Anchors extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ExodiusStudios.comment-anchors) for Visual Studio Code which places anchors within comments to allow for easy navigation and the ability to track TODO's, code reviews, etc. You may find the following tags intersperesed throughout the code in this repository: ANCHOR, TODO, FIXME, STUB, NOTE, REVIEW, SECTION, LINK, CELL, FUNCTION, CLASS

For anyone using this extension, please note that CELL, FUNCTION, and CLASS are tags I defined myself.
